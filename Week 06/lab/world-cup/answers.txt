Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 
Spain was tied with Brazil and Belgium at 20% in the first simulation. The last simulation put it in fourth place

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 
At around 10000 simulations, the predictions stabilized
