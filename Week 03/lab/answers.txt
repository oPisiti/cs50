sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: With sorted arrays, it scales less than n², which is the case for the other types of input arrays.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Fastest sorting across the board. All the times are similar for random, reversed and sorted. The way it scales with the size is negligible from 5000 to 10000 and only 3 times from 10000 to 50000 indicating a scalability of less than n².

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: The time it takes to sort any array scales with n².
